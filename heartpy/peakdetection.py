def make_windows(data, sample_rate, windowsize=120, overlap=0, min_size=20):
    '''slices data into windows

    Funcion that slices data into windows for concurrent analysis.
    Used by process_segmentwise wrapper function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1-d array
        array containing heart rate sensor data

    sample_rate : int or float
        sample rate of the data stream in 'data'

    windowsize : int
        size of the window that is sliced in seconds

    overlap : float
        fraction of overlap between two adjacent windows: 0 <= float < 1.0

    min_size : int
        the minimum size for the last (partial) window to be included. Very short windows
        might not stable for peak fitting, especially when significant noise is present.
        Slightly longer windows are likely stable but don't make much sense from a
        signal analysis perspective.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        tuples of window indices

    Examples
    --------
    Assuming a given example data file:

    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> data, _ = hp.load_exampledata(1)

    We can split the data into windows:

    >>> indices = make_windows(data, 100.0, windowsize = 30, overlap = 0.5, min_size = 20)
    >>> indices.shape
    (9, 2)

    Specifying min_size = -1 will include the last window no matter what:

    >>> indices = make_windows(data, 100.0, windowsize = 30, overlap = 0.5, min_size = -1)
    '''
    ln = len(data)
    window = windowsize * sample_rate
    stepsize = (1 - overlap) * window
    start = 0
    end = window

    slices = []
    while end < len(data):
        slices.append((start, end))
        start += stepsize
        end += stepsize

    if min_size == -1:
        slices[-1] = (slices[-1][0], len(data))
    elif (ln - start) / sample_rate >= min_size:
        slices.append((start, ln))

    return np.array(slices, dtype=np.int32)


def append_dict(dict_obj, measure_key, measure_value):
    '''appends data to keyed dict.

    Function that appends key to continuous dict, creates if doesn't exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dict_obj : dict
        dictionary object that contains continuous output measures

    measure_key : str
        key for the measure to be stored in continuous_dict

    measure_value : any data container
        value to be appended to dictionary

    Returns
    -------
    dict_obj : dict
        dictionary object passed to function, with specified data container appended

    Examples
    --------
    Given a dict object 'example' with some data in it:

    >>> example = {}
    >>> example['call'] = ['hello']

    We can use the function to append it:

    >>> example = append_dict(example, 'call', 'world')
    >>> example['call']
    ['hello', 'world']

    A new key will be created if it doesn't exist:

    >>> example = append_dict(example, 'different_key', 'hello there!')
    >>> sorted(example.keys())
    ['call', 'different_key']
    '''
    try:

def detect_peaks(hrdata, rol_mean, ma_perc, sample_rate, update_dict=True, working_data={}):
    '''detect peaks in signal

    Function that detects heartrate peaks in the given dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hr data : 1-d numpy array or list
        array or list containing the heart rate data

    rol_mean : 1-d numpy array
        array containing the rolling mean of the heart rate signal

    ma_perc : int or float
        the percentage with which to raise the rolling mean,
        used for fitting detection solutions to data

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate of the provided data set

    update_dict : bool
        whether to update the peak information in the module's data structure
        Settable to False to allow this function to be re-used for example by
        the breath analysis module.
        default : True

    Examples
    --------
    Normally part of the peak detection pipeline. Given the first example data
    it would work like this:

    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> from heartpy.datautils import rolling_mean
    >>> data, _ = hp.load_exampledata(0)
    >>> rol_mean = rolling_mean(data, windowsize = 0.75, sample_rate = 100.0)
    >>> wd = detect_peaks(data, rol_mean, ma_perc = 20, sample_rate = 100.0)

    Now the peaklist has been appended to the working data dict. Let's look
    at the first five peak positions:

    >>> wd['peaklist'][0:5]
    array([ 63, 165, 264, 360, 460], dtype=int64)
    '''
    rmean = np.array(rol_mean)

    #rol_mean = rmean + ((rmean / 100) * ma_perc)
    mn = np.std(hrdata)*4*ma_perc/100 
    rol_mean = rmean + mn

    peaksx = np.where((hrdata > rol_mean))[0]
    peaksy = hrdata[peaksx]
    peakedges = np.concatenate((np.array([0]),
                                (np.where(np.diff(peaksx) > 1)[0]),
                                np.array([len(peaksx)])))
    peaklist = []

    for i in range(0, len(peakedges)-1):
        try:
            y_values = peaksy[peakedges[i]:peakedges[i+1]].tolist()
            peaklist.append(peaksx[peakedges[i] + y_values.index(max(y_values))])
        except:
            pass

    if update_dict:
        working_data['peaklist'] = peaklist
        working_data['ybeat'] = [hrdata[x] for x in peaklist]
        working_data['rolling_mean'] = rol_mean
        working_data = calc_rr(working_data['peaklist'], sample_rate,
                               working_data=working_data)
        if len(working_data['RR_list']) > 0:
            working_data['rrsd'] = np.std(working_data['RR_list'])
        else:
            working_data['rrsd'] = np.inf
        return working_data
    else:
        return peaklist, working_data


def fit_peaks(hrdata, rol_mean, sample_rate, bpmmin=40, bpmmax=180, working_data={}):
    '''optimize for best peak detection

    Function that runs fitting with varying peak detection thresholds given a
    heart rate signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hrdata : 1d array or list
        array or list containing the heart rate data

    rol_mean : 1-d array
        array containing the rolling mean of the heart rate signal

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate of the data set

    bpmmin : int
        minimum value of bpm to see as likely
        default : 40

    bpmmax : int
        maximum value of bpm to see as likely
        default : 180

    Returns
    -------
    working_data : dict
        dictionary object that contains all heartpy's working data (temp) objects.
        will be created if not passed to function

    Examples
    --------
    Part of peak detection pipeline. Uses moving average as a peak detection
    threshold and rises it stepwise. Determines best fit by minimising
    standard deviation of peak-peak distances as well as getting a bpm that
    lies within the expected range.

    Given included example data let's show how this works

    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> from heartpy.datautils import rolling_mean
    >>> data, _ = hp.load_exampledata(0)
    >>> rol_mean = rolling_mean(data, windowsize = 0.75, sample_rate = 100.0)

    We can then call this function and let the optimizer do its work:

    >>> wd = fit_peaks(data, rol_mean, sample_rate = 100.0)

    Now the wd dict contains the best fit paramater(s):

    >>> wd['best']
    25

    This indicates the best fit can be obtained by raising the moving average
    with 25% of the standard deviation of the signal.

    The results of the peak detection using these parameters are included too.
    To illustrate, these are the first five detected peaks:

    >>> wd['peaklist'][0:5]
    array([ 63, 165, 264, 360, 460], dtype=int64)

    and the corresponding peak-peak intervals:

    >>> wd['RR_list'][0:4]
    array([1020.,  990.,  960., 1000.])
    '''

    # moving average values to test

        bpm = ((len(working_data['peaklist'])/(len(hrdata)/sample_rate))*60)
        rrsd.append([working_data['rrsd'], bpm, ma_perc])

    for _rrsd, _bpm, _ma_perc in rrsd:
        if (_rrsd > 0.1) and ((bpmmin <= _bpm <= bpmmax)):
            valid_ma.append([_rrsd, _ma_perc])

    Function that enables high-precision mode by taking the estimated peak position,

    estimating the peak position with higher accuracy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1d list or array
        list or array containing heart rate data

    peaks : 1d list or array
        list or array containing x-positions of peaks in signal

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate of the signal (in Hz)

    desired_sampled-rate : int or float
        the sample rate to which to upsample.
        Must be sample_rate < desired_sample_rate

    Returns
    -------
    working_data : dict
        working_data dictionary object containing all of heartpy's temp objects

    Examples
    --------
    Given the output of a normal analysis and the first five peak-peak intervals:

    Now, the resolution is at max 10ms as that's the distance between data points.
    We can use the high precision mode for example to approximate a more precise
    position, for example if we had recorded at 1000Hz:

    >>> wd = interpolate_peaks(data = data, peaks = wd['peaklist'],
    ... sample_rate = 100.0, desired_sample_rate = 1000.0, working_data = wd)
    >>> wd['peaklist'][0:5]
    array([ 63.5, 165.4, 263.6, 360.4, 460.2])

    As you can see the accuracy of peak positions has increased.
    Note that you cannot magically upsample nothing into something. Be reasonable.
